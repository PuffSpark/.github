# PuffSpark

We are a small group of friends just starting our journey in development.  
Previously known as **AvcFurTeam** **AvcVoid**, and before that **Bovi**.  
We don’t have any finished projects yet, but we have ideas and the drive to learn.

## What we plan to do
- Experiment with creating games and small applications
- Learn new technologies and programming languages
- Build small utilities for ourselves and friends
- Work on projects with atmosphere and story

## Our approach
We do this primarily for fun and experience.  
Our main goals are to learn, try new things, and support each other.
